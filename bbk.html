      Barnabókaklubbin is a Faroese children’s book club whose everyday work relies on
      manual coordination across loosely connected systems. In this project, we explored how
      Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can support membership onboarding while still
      leaving room for human judgement, local knowledge and organisational learning.

          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Membership administration in Barnabókaklubbin happens across a web form,
            Outlook, Excel, Navision 2018 and Brevo (CRM). None of these systems are fully
            integrated, so staff move data manually between them and use their own overview
            and judgement to keep everything consistent and running. Membership creation for
            a single child can take around ten minutes and depends heavily on one key
            employee knowing the “right way” to do things.
          </p>
          <p>
            This makes the organisation vulnerable: if the person with the overview is sick or
            leaves, it becomes difficult to keep track of members, payments and book
            shipments – but a full system replacement is neither realistic nor affordable in the
            short term.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Research focus</h2>
          <p>
            The project investigates how RPA can support membership onboarding in a small,
            low-maturity organisation without replacing human judgement. We focus on the
            membership registration flow because it is well-defined, repetitive and based on
            structured input, yet time-consuming and error-prone when done manually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Methodologically, we combine qualitative interviews, process mapping and service
            blueprinting with a design-based approach: we analyse current practice, derive
            design principles and implement a working RPA prototype that can be evaluated in
            the organisation.

          <h2>My role – technical lead</h2>
          <p>
            I was responsible for the entire technical side of the project:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Designing the overall automation concept and flow structure.</li>
            <li>Developing the full Power Automate Desktop flow for membership onboarding.</li>
            <li>
              Implementing robust parsing of HTML e-mails from the online registration form
              into structured variables.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automating data entry in Navision 2018, including debtor creation, payment
              setup and the link to Rokningardepilin.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automating creation of webshop users and Brevo CRM contacts connected to the
              new member.
            </li>
            <li>
              Debugging selectors, handling timing issues and making the flow modular and
              maintainable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Documenting the flow in detail and preparing material for testing and
              evaluation.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h2>Process & approach</h2>

          <h3>1. Understanding existing work</h3>
          <p>
            Together with my group, I mapped the current (“as-is”) membership process using
            interviews and a service blueprint. This showed how much of the daily work
            consists of “glue tasks” – copying data between systems, checking for errors and
            compensating for missing integration – and how strongly the process relies on one
            person’s tacit knowledge.
          </p>

          <h3>2. From analysis to design principles</h3>
          <p>
            Based on the analysis, we formulated design principles for the future solution:
            focus on stable, rule-based steps; keep the automation modular; make data quality
            visible; and ensure a clear division of labour between RPA and staff. Automation
            should support the existing practice where it is already stable, not introduce
            completely new ways of working overnight.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Building the RPA flow</h3>
          <p>
            I implemented a Power Automate Desktop flow split into four logical modules:
            <em>Main</em> (parsing the e-mail), <em>Navision2</em> (debtor creation and payment
            setup), <em>Webshop users</em> (creating the webshop login) and <em>Brevo</em>
            (creating the CRM contact). Each module can be adapted or extended separately if
            systems change.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>What the automation does</h2>
          <p>
            In practice, the flow works like this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Reads the newest registration e-mail from a dedicated inbox via IMAP and
              cleans the HTML into line-based text.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maps field labels (e.g. child’s name, guardian, address, bank details) to
              variables using a custom “previous label” strategy, including date conversion and
              basic validation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Opens Navision 2018, creates a new debtor, fills in master data and financial
              settings, and updates Rokningardepilin with account and registration numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creates a linked webshop user with the correct customer number and default
              login settings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Opens Brevo in the browser, navigates to the CRM module and creates a contact
              subscribed to the relevant lists.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The only manual step for staff is to trigger the flow from a desktop shortcut and
            provide the shared passwords when prompted.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Evaluation & impact</h2>
          <p>
            We evaluated the prototype through a test membership registration together with
            the responsible employee. The flow completed the entire onboarding – across
            e-mail, Navision, webshop and Brevo – in about four minutes. The equivalent
            manual process normally takes around ten minutes and requires much more active
            concentration, system-switching and double-checking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though we only ran a limited test, it showed that the flow is technically
            robust in a standard case and that it aligns well with the staff member’s
            expectations. At the same time, the test highlighted that the solution will require
            ongoing maintenance when input formats, systems or business rules change.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Key learnings</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In small organisations, selective automation of stable sub-processes is often
              more realistic than “full automation” of everything.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data quality work and clear process descriptions are necessary pre-conditions
              for RPA – otherwise the robot mainly automates existing mess.
            </li>
            <li>
              Modular flow design makes it easier to debug and evolve the solution when the
              system landscape gradually changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Human judgement remains central: the RPA flow handles the repetitive,
              rule-based work, while staff keep responsibility for exceptions, edge cases and
              member communication.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Overall, the project shows how Power Automate can act as a practical bridge
            between Barnabókaklubbin’s current systems and a more integrated digital
            infrastructure in the future.
